A powerful platform for deciphering proteome profiling of multi-tumour mass spectrometry data using deep learning 

## Brief Description
**MSpectraAI** is actually a comprehensive web tool for mining and classifying raw LC-MS<sup>2</sup>-based proteomics or metabolomics data of different samples using deep learning models. Users can also built your own deep neural network model in this software. It is developed with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (https://www.r-project.org/) and an example is shown here: [http://www.omicsolution.org/wukong/MSpectraAI/](http://www.omicsolution.org/wukong/MSpectraAI/).
